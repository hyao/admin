To use boto, one needs to configure aws env, change the setup-aws-env accordingly, and source it.

1. install ansible from ansible.cc
2. add ec2 instance public dns name to ~/ansible_hosts
in the format of:
[yourhost]
aws_ec2_dns_name.com

3. cd into ansible dir:
source ./hacking/env-setup

4. run ansible-playbook (need to adapt private key location):
ansible-playbook -u ubuntu --private-key=your_key playbook.yml
